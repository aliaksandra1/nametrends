Sometimes, strange questions pop into my head. For example, I've been wondering if the Harry Potter movies and books have had an impact on the choice of names for children. But what more books or movies? Is there a difference in the choice of names between the USA and the UK? In this little notebook, I'll try to explore these questions.

I obtained a dataframe about baby names in the UK from a library in the R language, authored and maintained by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel. For the USA, I retrieved a dataframe about baby names from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/donkea/ssa-names-1910-2021).
